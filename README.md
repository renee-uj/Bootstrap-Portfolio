# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description

This was another attempt at creating a portfolio with the added benefit of using Bootstrap in the HTML code. For this project I was not provided any starter code (HTML or CSS) or any images just the creative freedom to create a portfolio with the following sections: Welcome, About, Work, Skills and Contact. While I was able to add the majority of the sections to the page I had trouble with the button functionality. However, compared to my other portfolio, I found the addition of the Bootstrap technology to be a big help in the layout of the page.

Bootstrap has helped my understanding and consolidation of CSS and HTML. Moving forward I will use Bootstrap within my HTML code as it takes away the stress of getting the elements in the correct place. 

## Usage
